Python developer learning through real projects and constant iteration.
Currently working on Dual Deck (a DJ deck engine) and other tools exploring UI, audio processing, and real‑time state management.
Improving in testing, refactoring and GUI development while building software that is simple, stable and easy to understand.

Always learning, always building.
