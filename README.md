Technical professional transitioning into SaaS and support engineering roles. I combine strong customer-facing experience with a growing technical foundation in Python, pytest, Git/GitHub, and basic automation.

Currently building a media player project with a professional test suite to strengthen my QA mindset and better understand how real software is tested and maintained.

Interested in:
- Software quality and QA thinking
- Technical Support & Customer Success in SaaS
- Testing with pytest (fixtures, parametrization, mocks)
- Using AI to learn, document, and improve workflows
- Terminal skills, PowerShell, and Git best practices

Always learning, always building.
